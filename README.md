# Field Support for Batteries

## Hint to get started

## Notes

- The application uses for its design and layout.
- The login page does not require authentication; it is for demonstration purposes only and does not validate credentials.
- I added random school names for a better UX 


### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the application
```
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at the local address shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

### Run tests
```
npm test
```

## Folder Structure
- `src/components/` - Vue components
- `src/data/` - Battery data JSON
- `src/views/` - Main views/pages

---

## Good luck !
